# 🚀 Workforce Management API - Submission

## ✅ Assignment Completion Summary

I have successfully implemented the Workforce Management API with all the required **bug fixes** and **new features**, as specified in the assignment prompt.

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Overview

### 📦 Project Setup
- Created a fully functional Spring Boot 3.0.4 project using Gradle.
- Organized the codebase with clean separation of concerns across `controller`, `service`, `repository`, `model`, and `dto` packages.
- Configured `build.gradle` with necessary dependencies: Spring Web, Lombok, and MapStruct.
- Set up application properties for local development.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

### 🔧 Bug #1: Task Re-assignment Creates Duplicates
- **Problem**: When reassigning tasks via `/assign-by-ref`, previous tasks were not removed, leading to duplicate active tasks.
- **Fix**: In `assignByReference()`, only one matching task is reassigned to the new assignee. All other similar tasks are marked as `CANCELLED`.
- **Code Location**:
    - `TaskManagementServiceImpl.java` → Lines **75–105**

### 🔧 Bug #2: Cancelled Tasks Clutter the View
- **Problem**: The `/fetch-by-date/v2` endpoint returned cancelled tasks, cluttering the employee’s view.
- **Fix**: Applied a filter in `fetchTasksByDate()` to exclude tasks with status `CANCELLED`.
- **Code Location**:
    - `TaskManagementServiceImpl.java` → Line **113**

## ✨ New Features

### 🌟 Feature #1: Smart Daily Task View
- **Functionality**: Enhanced date-based fetching logic to include:
    1. Active tasks created within the specified date range.
    2. Active tasks created before the date range but still not completed.
- **Code Location**:
    - `TaskManagementServiceImpl.java` → Lines **114–130**

---

### 🔥 Feature #2: Task Priority System
- **Functionality**:
    - Introduced a `Priority` enum (`HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`).
    - Added a `priority` field in the `TaskManagement` model.
    - Created:
        - Endpoint to update a task’s priority → `POST /task-mgmt/update-priority`
        - Endpoint to fetch tasks by priority → `GET /task-mgmt/priority/{priority}`
    - Activity logs record priority changes.
- **Code Locations**:
    - Enum: `Priority.java`
    - Service: `TaskManagementServiceImpl.java` → Lines **133–145**
    - Controller: `TaskManagementController.java` → Lines **44–51**

---

### 🗨️ Feature #3: Task Comments & Activity History
- **Functionality**:
    1. **Activity History**: Automatic logging for actions like task creation, updates, reassignment, and priority changes.
    2. **User Comments**: Free-text comments linked to tasks.
    3. **Task View**: Fetching task by ID returns full chronological history of comments and activities.
- **Code Locations**:
    - Models: `TaskComment.java`, `TaskActivity.java`
    - Service: `TaskManagementServiceImpl.java` → Lines **147–160**
    - Controller: `TaskManagementController.java` → Lines **54–57**
    - Repository: `InMemoryTaskRepository.java` → Lines **85–130**

## 💡 Technical Highlights

### 🧱 Architecture
- Clean architecture with proper layering: Controller → Service → Repository
- Constructor-based dependency injection
- Global exception handler (`CustomExceptionHandler.java`) for consistent API errors

### 📊 Data Handling
- **In-memory storage**: Used `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread-safe task storage
- **Atomic counters**: Ensure unique IDs in concurrent scenarios
- **Seed data**: Preloaded tasks and scenarios for testing all features

### 🧰 Utilities & Tools
- **MapStruct**: Clean, type-safe DTO to model mapping
- **Lombok**: Removes boilerplate via annotations like `@Data`
- **Standardized responses**: Unified response wrapper with status and pagination support
- **Snake Case JSON**: For frontend compatibility and clean API design

## ✅ Testing & Demonstration Strategy

Pre-loaded seed data allows testing of:
- Duplicate task reassignment (Bug #1)
- Fetching with cancelled tasks (Bug #2)
- Task priority filtering (Feature #2)
- Activity and comment logs (Feature #3)

### 🔑 Demo Endpoints:

| Feature | Endpoint |
|--------|----------|
| 🔍 Get Task (with history & comments) | `GET /task-mgmt/1` |
| 🔁 Assign by Reference (Bug #1) | `POST /task-mgmt/assign-by-ref` |
| 📅 Smart Fetch by Date (Bug #2 + Feature #1) | `POST /task-mgmt/fetch-by-date/v2` |
| 🔼 Update Priority | `POST /task-mgmt/update-priority` |
| 🎯 Get by Priority | `GET /task-mgmt/priority/HIGH` |
| 💬 Add Comment | `POST /task-mgmt/add-comment` |
